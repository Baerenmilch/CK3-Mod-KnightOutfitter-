Hello everyone,

I'm new to the forum and modding, so please forgive me if I ask stupid questions :)

I'm trying to create an event with a barbershop template and a scripted effect to change the clothes of my knights.

The event also starts (at least via console command, as I unfortunately haven't figured out how to integrate it into the decision menu yet), but changing the clothes doesn't work, can you please check where I made a mistake.
